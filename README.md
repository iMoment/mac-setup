## New MacBook Setup

This repository contains info on all the apps / tools / settings I use on my personal MacBook for development.

## What MacBook do I have?

I purchased a 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro when it was first released. The tech specs for it can be found [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP809?locale=en_US).

Unfortunately, after returning from a trip to China, it suddenly ended up dying, and the cost of repair was better off used towards a new purchase instead.

I am now using the 2023 16" M3 Max MacBook Pro. 

These are the specs at a glance:
* Apple M3 Max (14-core CPU, 30-core GPU)
* 36GB RAM
* 1TB SSD
